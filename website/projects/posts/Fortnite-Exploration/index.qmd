Fortnite is an online video game where players compete or collaborate in a colorful, fast-paced world filled with building, exploration, and action. Beyond being a game, Fortnite has evolved into a creative platform where users can design and publish their own interactive experiencesâ€”similar to how STEAM hosts and distributes games made by developers. Our team is learning UEFN (Unreal Editor for Fortnite) to gain hands-on experience in game development, world-building, and publishing on a cutting-edge, real-world platform.
