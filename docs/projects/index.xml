  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>SSG is contributing to a platform service provider review with IT4Cause, supporting the mission of Islamic Relief USA as they explore options for a new case management provider. This activity allows our students to focus on a crucial aspect of software work: making a case for a particular implementation based on very specific organizational needs.</p>

<p>This project develops our own website, both as a means of training students on contemporary web development tools and techniques and as a means of creating a visible public face for our activities. As a multi-project, crossfunctional VIP, we have a rich and varied story to tell, and we are making a website that lets our participants show the world their excellent work!</p>

  <title>Fortnite Exploration</title>
  <link>https://internal.ssgvip.com/projects/posts/Fortnite-Exploration/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>As Chris Dixon once noted, emerging technologies start out looking like toys, or in this case, video games. The Unreal Engine for Forrnite (UEFN) and related Verse programming language, made by Epic Games, is a massively powerful tool for creating user generated content in a massive online world. We are exploring how to meaningfully build content for daily life of a university student based on “game” interfaces.</p>

  <title>Small Business and Supplier Diversity Chatbot</title>
  <link>https://internal.ssgvip.com/projects/posts/Chatbot/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>SSG designed, deployed and delivered a chatbot that can be accessed from specific pages within a website as well as from within a web-based application by clicking a link or button. The chatbot was able to answer questions typed into a provided field, based on a list of questions and corresponding answers maintained with the chat bot system. The chatbot should also have the ability to route the user to their choice of additional support through phone and email.</p>

<p>This project, initiated and managed by SSG alum Inho Park, worked with multiple institutional stakeholders to design service quality improvements to VCU’s “RamSafe” ride service. This required a deep exploration of routing and ride hailing software, as well as sustained engagement with a rapidly growing startup in this field.</p>
