title: CoPath (RamSafe)
subtitle: A partnership with The Routing Company and VCU Parking and Transportation Services
description: |
  CoPath aims to change the concept of Demand-Responsive Transport (DRT) for the better. This is described as ride-pooled buses functioning similarly to taxis with fares that are approximately the same rate public transit typically charges. It’s comparable to services such as VCU’s RamSafe.

This project, initiated and managed by SSG alum Inho Park, worked with multiple institutional stakeholders to design service quality improvements to VCU’s “RamSafe” ride service. This required a deep exploration of routing and ride hailing software, as well as sustained engagement with a rapidly growing startup in this field.
