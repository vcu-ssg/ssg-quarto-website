This project, initiated and managed by SSG alum Inho Park, worked with multiple institutional stakeholders to design service quality improvements to VCU’s “RamSafe” ride service. This required a deep exploration of routing and ride hailing software, as well as sustained engagement with a rapidly growing startup in this field.
